2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-04  Levente Meszaros

    Added IPv4Configurator, a new network configurator for IPv4

    This is intended to replace both routing files (.irt/.mrt) and
    specialized network configurators like FlatNetworkConfigurator,
    and do much more.

    Covers address assignment (manual, automatic), adding manual routes,
    setting up static routing, optimizing the routing tables, etc.
    Unlike FlatNetworkConfigurator, it will generate per-interface
    addresses. Wireless networks are also supported.

	Adapted to change: "host" in IPv4Route renamed to "destination"

	FlatnetworkConfigurator: refined WeightedTopology support

2011-12-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	bugfix for #465: FlatNetworkConfigurator calculated wrong paths
	when multihomed hosts were present. Solution: if IPForward==false
	for a host, add it with weight=INFINITY to the graph so no routes
	will go through it. Requires base/WeightedTopology (or OMNeT++ 4.3
	when it'll be available)

2011-12-15  Andras Varga

	NetworkConfigurator removed (it was incomplete; added back on a branch)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Project Features support: autorouting/ split into autorouting/ipv4/
	and autorouting/ipv6/

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	code style

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

	FlatNetworkConfigurator to use @node properties instead of moduleTypes
	parameter

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-07-03  Andras Varga

	* FlatNetworkConfigurator[6]: nonIPModuleTypes are now implicitly added
	to moduleTypes. Before, one had to add e.g. EtherSwitch to both -- now
	it's enough to add it to nonIPModuleTypes.
