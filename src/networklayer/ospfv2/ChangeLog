2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-01  Levente Meszaros

    Gateway is now correcty set on routing entries.

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	IPv4Route: member variables made private, updated OSPFv2 and BGP
	accordingly

	OSPFv2 and BGP had redundant getters/setters in OSPFRoutingTableEntry
	etc, they were removed

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Adapted to change: "host" in IPv4Route renamed to "destination"

2012-01-09  Andras Varga

	Adapted to RoutingTable change: IPv4Route pointers returned by
	RoutingTable are no longer const

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation

2010-09-22  Andras Varga

	Changes related to the new BGP model: OSPFRouting::insertExternalRoute(),
	etc.

2010-08-13  Andras Varga

	* coding style made more consistent with the rest of the INET:
	- changed method names to start with lower-case letter
	- changed enum constants to all-capitals with underscores
	- removed excessive in-line spaces
	- removed superfluous "void" keywords from arg-less methods

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-12-11  Andras Varga

	* added LGPL headers to files

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-05-01  Andras Varga

	* checked in more patches from author of this model, Andras Babos

2005-10-28  Andras Varga

	Initial revision of the OSPFv2 model, written by Andras Babos for MSc
	final project at TU Budapest, with some help from Andras Varga.

	If you are interested in the early history of the OSPF code, change
	to the project root and type
