	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	manet compile fix: a const std::set<> can only be iterated with
	const_iterator

	It appears to be a bug in gcc that it accepts plain iterator (only for
	std::set though, the same with std::vector or std::map causes an error).

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: renamed address/port params to localAddress/localPort where
	appropriate

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent thoughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I didn't touch external code that was ported into INET and is likely
	 to be updated in the future with newer versions: aodv-uu, dsr-uu,
	dymoum,
	 lwIP, etc.

	- I used omnetpp\_scripts\tidymodel\spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.
