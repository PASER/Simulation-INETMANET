2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed lowergateIn to lowerLayerIn and lowergateOut to lowerLayerOut.

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored mobility modules.

	See ChangeLog in the mobility directory for details.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Added a SPEED_OF_LIGHT global constant in INETDefs.h

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Original channel controller modified to work with radios instead of
	hosts. Channel controller extended is removed.

2011-05-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Channel comntrol and ChannelControlExtended is merged and become
	ChannelCOntrolExtended. AirframeExtended is merged into AirFrame

2011-05-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	Mobility made independent of ChannelControl

	- moved ChannelControl* to world/radio

	- merged ChannelAccessExtended to ChannelAccess

	- host registration was moved from Mobility to the radio modules.
	 (There can be multiple radios per host, so ChannelControlExtended
	 now maintains a registration count for each host.)
	 Mobility now doesn't refer to ChannelControl at all, so one can
	 create mobile networks that don't contain ChannelControl at all;
	 ChannelControl is only needed for radio communication.

	- global playgroundSizeX/Y parameters have been replaced with
	 per-mobility constraintAreaX/Y, constraintAreaWidth/Height
	 parameters for most mobility modules
	 NOTE: Playground is now conceptionally unlimited, only the
	 movement of individual nodes are (can be) constrained to
	 rectangular areas. (This change was needed because mobility
	 modules now don't access ChannelControl that used to contain
	 the playgroundSizeX/Y parameters.)

	- x,y parameters have been renamed to initialX/Y; a new
	 initFromDisplayString parameter controls whether the initial
	 coordinates come from the display string or from the parameters
	 (for most modules; some mobility modules don't have these parameters)

	Example simulations are updated in a separate commit.

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Removed different Ieee802.11 wireless NICs. Only Ieee80211 remained and
	the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	new place for PowerControl; base radio feature for 802.11 features

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	mf80211 and iee80211 can be compiled separately

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	mf80211, ieee80211 and mobility feature

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2010-11-23  Rudolf Hornig

	Bugfix for change channel(state must be IDLE if channel change
	occurred).

2010-11-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Added multiple radio support, wireless module if and an AdhocHost for
	general use (without dynamic routing support) . MANET routing can be
	added later to this host  type.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	removed obsolete and misleading !WORK_IN_PROGRESS! files

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-09-30  Andras Varga

	introduced a utility function for interface name creation

2010-11-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	ieee80211: sensitivity unit is dBm, not mW

2010-02-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	Bugfix: printf "%d" and int64 getByteLength()

2010-01-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Fix: changed the unit of sensitivity from mW to dBm

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	added default icons (mostly to *App modules)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels; Radio changed into a moduleinterface as it was
	originally intended

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)
