	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)

	already provided by <omnetpp.h>
